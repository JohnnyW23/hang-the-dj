# hang-the-dj
Python project of the famous Hangman game. Portuguese (BR) translation available.

# Instructions
It's a very simple game, if you don't know yet. You have to guess the secret word by trying a different letter each round. You got 6 chances. Each time you type a wrong guess, you lose a chance and a part of the man's body is drawn. When the entire man is hanged, you lose. When you guess all the letters before the man in hanged, you win.

# Words database
You can choose a secret word when you start the game (if you're playing with friends) or you can set the program to choose a word for you. The words come from a database I created inside it, with 417 different words (I hope it's different, since I asked GPT to do it for me, and it may commit mistakes sometimes, like typing the same word again). The portuguese version has 600 different words in the database.
I had the option to set the words from the "nltk" module, but it depends on installing it, and I preffered a more comfortable experience for the user in this game.
There is much, much more I need to know about programming so, if there is a good and better way to deliver a comfortable experience for the user while using a massive word database, let me know! :)

# Translation
Portuguese (BR) translation of the code and in-game elements is available.
