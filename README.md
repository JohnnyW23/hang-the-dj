# hangman-game
Python project of the famous Hangman game. Portuguese (BR) translation available.
Projeto Python do famoso Jogo da Forca. Tradução para Portugues (BR) disponível.

# Instructions
It's a very simple game, if you don't know yet. You have to guess the secret word by trying a different letter each round. You got 6 chances. Each time you type a wrong guess, you lose a chance and a part of the man's body is drawn. When the entire man is hanged, you lose. When you guess all the letters before the man in hanged, you win.

# Word database
You can choose a secret word when you start the game (if you're playing with friends) or you can set the program to choose a word for you. The words come from a database I created inside it, with 2466 different words. The portuguese version has 29115 different words in the database.

# Game features
The game accepts any guess you choose, even containing hyphens, numbers and spaces.

# Translation
Portuguese (BR) translation of the code and in-game elements is available.
